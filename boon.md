Upon purchasing their first Boon in the Animal purview, Scions must choose a specific animal as their favored one for purposes of the purview. All powers refer to and affect only that animal unless otherwise specified, though the Scion may buy the same Boon more than once in order to use it on more than one kind of creature. Scions can have 1 animal, Demigods can have 2, Gods can have 3.
### ANIMAL COMMUNICATION ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
Upon purchasing this Boon, the Scion becomes able to communicate effortlessly with specimens of his chosen animal through their native speech (by chirping, growling, bubbling, etc).
### ANIMAL OBEDIENCE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Animal Ken
Difficulty: Animal’s Intelligence X Animal’s (Legend – 1)
The Scion with this Boon may force a specimen of his chosen animal to do his bidding, whether it wants to or not. He may not force the animal to act in what it would consider an actively suicidal manner, and animals frequently do not understand complex, multi-part instructions, but he may instruct it to do anything within these limits. If the Scion does not have Animal Communication, he must be able to communicate his order nonverbally. If the Scion attempts to command a Legendary beast, the difficulty of the roll is multiplied by the creature’s Legend – 1.
### ANIMAL ADAPTATION ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
Once per story arc, the Scion may choose to change his chosen animal. This will last for the remainder of the story arc, or until the scion wishes for it to be changed back.
### ANIMAL ASPECT ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per action
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken
Upon purchasing this Boon, the Scion’s player must choose (with GM approval) two attributes (with a maximum of one physical) that he believes are the most favored by his chosen animal (for example, an owl might use Perception and Intelligence, or an armadillo Stamina and Wits). When activating this Boon, the Scion may add his successes as temporary dots of one of those two attributes. If he wishes the bonus to persist past the first action that he takes, he may pay additional Legend, but he must do so when he first activates the power and cannot do so reflexively later; the Boon’s effects last for a number of turns equal to the number of Legend points he chooses to spend (and he must spend a minimum of three). A Scion may never call upon the aspects of two different animals at once; only one use of this Boon may be active at one time.
### CALL OF THE WILD ●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Animal Ken
The Scion with this Boon is able to attune herself to her chosen creatures so perfectly that they are drawn to her as if summoned. By calling them in some appropriate manner (howling, buzzing, or calling out in their language), the Scion may put out a call to all specimens of her chosen animal within a radius equal to her successes in miles, exhorting them to find her. Affected animals immediately begin traveling toward her, though depending on their natural speed they may take some time to reach her. If at any point the Scion deems she has made contact with enough animals, she may call out to inform nearby animals that she no longer requires their presence; all those still journeying toward her are free to return to whatever they were doing (though some may still arrive, lost or curious). Once they have arrived, most animals will be inclined to remain with the Scion for at least a little while, though nothing forces them to do so if they circumstances are uncomfortable or threatening.
### RIDE ANIMAL ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken
Difficulty: Animal’s Intelligence X Animal’s (Legend – 1)
The Scion with this Boon may possess and control the body of any specimen of her chosen animal, directing it at will as if it were her own. While doing so, her own body remains in a trance and is both unable to perceive its surroundings and unable to take actions; if at any time her body takes damage while she is riding a beast, she may spend a point of Willpower to briefly peer back through her own perceptions to see what caused this distraction. The Scion may return to her body whenever she wishes, though doing so breaks her link with her chosen creature.
### ANIMAL FEATURE ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use, and 1 Legend per feature
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken
The Scion with this Boon may physically alter a feature of his body into one possessed by his chosen animal; he might grow wings or a beak, claws, a tail, or any other feature that he deems useful. Doing so allows him to add his total number of Animal Boons as dice to an ability associated with that feature (as in Animal Aspect, the player must decide what ability each feature grants when this Boon is purchased, and may not change this choice later). Features with an auxiliary use (i.e., wings that allow flight, gills that allow water breathing, etc.) do not provide an additional dice bonus. Every five successes on his activation roll allow him to activate another feature, to a maximum of half the number of Boons he has in the Animal purview, rounded down. The feature remains for the rest of the scene, or until the Scion voluntarily chooses to return to his usual form.
### HIVE MIND ●●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Perception + Animal Ken
By opening her mind and spreading her consciousness out into the area around her, the Scion with this Boon can make contact with those of her chosen animal that are near, slipping into their minds and experiencing the world through their senses as she pleases. Once she has spent the activation cost, the Scion may simultaneously perceive through the senses of all specimens of her chosen animal within a radius equal to her successes in miles, tasting, seeing, feeling and otherwise experiencing everything they do. While she cannot truly control them while thus spread out, she can cause them to search for specific things that she might be looking for, potentially turning a forest full of squirrels or a kennel full of dogs into her own squad of investigators. She may choose to inhabit as many or as few animals as she wishes, and she may remain a part of their senses for as long as she remains in the area or until she chooses to disengage of her own accord.
### ANIMAL FORM ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per transformation
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon may transform completely into a normal specimen of her chosen animal. This transformation takes place at will whenever the Scion desires; the animal in question appears perfectly normal to unaugmented eyes, and the Scion retains her mental attributes, Epic Attributes and Knacks while thus transformed but cannot access any of her normal physical or social powers.
### NATURAL ARMY ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per transformation
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon may transform into a number of normal specimens of his chosen animal equal to his body weight (minimum of 5). The animals produced share a hive mind and the Scion is able to direct them all as if he were only one creature instead of many. The animals in question appear perfectly normal to unaugmented eyes, and the Scion retains his mental Attributes, Epic Attributes and Knacks while thus transformed but cannot access any of his normal physical or social powers. The Scion may transform into the animals and back at any time, as long as one of the animals remains alive and conscious. Obviously, this power is only useful for Scions whose chosen animals are smaller than themselves, and does not work for others; a Scion’s chosen animal must weigh a maximum of one-fifth of his weight (though weight-increasing powers such as Jotunblut or Unusual Alteration may make increase a Scion’s weight to make larger animals possible).
### CREATE ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend, 1 Willpower and 3 lethal damage per use
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken
After cutting herself, the Scion may create normal specimens of her chosen animal from her very blood, allowing them to spring fully-formed into being, ready to follow her commands. Once created, the creatures are permanent unless killed.
|Creatures |Units per Successes Rolled |
|---|---|
|Speck (ant, tick, seahorse) |100 |
|Tiny (grasshopper, hummingbird) |50 |
|Small (raven, housecat, badger) |10 |
|Modest (wolf, kangaroo, lynx) |2 |
|Normal (lion, dolphin, tiger) |1/2 |
|Large (horse, bear) |1/4 |
|Huge (elephant, great white shark) |1/6 |
|Enormous (whale, giant squid) |1/10 |
### PAPER TIGER ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 6 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art
By creating a piece of art representing a specimen of his chosen animal (whether a painting, sculpture, carving, etc.), the Scion may then summon forth that animal from the artwork at any time as long as he pays one Legend to do so. Artwork thus created is considered a Relic and is extremely difficult to destroy until this boon is used, whereupon it loses its special properties and cannot be used for purposes of this boon again. The animal is a normal specimen of the Scion’s chosen creature, and once created is permanent unless killed.
|Creatures |Units per Successes Rolled |
|---|---|
|Speck (ant, tick, seahorse) |100 |
|Tiny (grasshopper, hummingbird) |50 |
|Small (raven, housecat, badger) |10 |
|Modest (wolf, kangaroo, lynx) |2 |
|Normal (lion, dolphin, tiger) |1/2 |
|Large (horse, bear) |1/4 |
|Huge (elephant, great white shark) |1/6 |
|Enormous (whale, giant squid) |1/10 |
### CREATE NEMEAN ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 6 Legend, 2 Willpower and 6 lethal damage per use
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken
Difficulty: (Creature’s highest physical Attribute) x (Desired Legend rating – 1)
After cutting herself, the Scion may create a Nemean specimen of her chosen animal from her very blood, allowing it to spring fully-formed into being, ready to follow her commands. Once created, the beast is permanent unless killed.
### EPIC ENHANCEMENT ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per roll
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken
The Scion may enhance a normal specimen of his animal, granting it bonuses beyond its normal abilities and effectively turning it into a Legendary beast. The Scion must decide how many times he wishes to roll before activating the power; he cannot add rolls mid-use, and he can only enhance a given animal once. Once he has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements as follows:
|Successes |Enhancement |
|---|---|
|1 Success |+1 to Ability, or Mental or Social Attribute |
|2 Successes |+1 to Accuracy, DV or Soaks |
|3 Successes |+1 to Dexterity, or Epic Mental or Social Attribute |
|4 Successes |+1 to Strength or Stamina, or increase size by 100% |
|5 Successes |+1 to Epic Physical Attribute |
|10 Successes |+1 to Legend rating (maximum of Scion’s Legend – 1) |
The Scion may not increase any given animal’s physical Attributes, accuracy, DV, soaks or damage (through any combination of enhancements) past five times the creature’s total Legend plus the number size increases he has applied to it, and may not increase any of its mental or social attributes past five times the creature’s Legend. While the Scion may normally only enhance normal, non-Legendary animals with this Boon, he may also use it once on a Birthright animal, even if it is already Legendary.
### NEMEAN SCROLL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 12 Legend and 2 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art
Difficulty: (Creature’s highest physical attribute) X (desired Legend rating – 1)
By creating a piece of art representing an enhanced specimen of his chosen animal (whether a painting, sculpture, carving, etc.), the Scion may then summon forth that animal from the artwork at any time as long as he pays one Legend to do so. The artwork created is considered a Relic and is extremely difficult to destroy until this boon is used, whereupon it loses its special properties and cannot be used for purposes of this boon again. The animal is a Nemean specimen of the Scion’s chosen creature, and is permanent unless killed.
### BESTIAL NATURE ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower dot per use
**Dice Pool:** None
By concentrating on her physical form and invoking the qualities of her favored creature, the Scion may take on select features permanently, becoming a hybrid of Scion and beast in truth. Whenever she chooses to add a feature, she may spend the requisite cost and replace part of her body with that of her animal, adding claws, wings, or even more bestial traits to her appearance; for every feature she chooses to take on she gains a permanent bonus of successes equal to her total number of Animal Boons to all uses of any one purview associated with that feature (for example, eagle claws that add to her use of War Boons or a bloodhound nose that adds to her use of Justice). The Scion may choose any purview that she can reasonably relate to a feature except for Animal, which can never receive a bonus from this Boon; she may add this bonus to Mystery, but doing so grants an equivalent number of dice instead of successes. The Scion may add as many features to herself as she wishes to pay Willpower for, but she may not use this Boon if her total number of Willpower dots is five or lower, as she doesn’t have the strength of will to force her body to change its substance so completely.
### HYBRID CHIMERA ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 – 25 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Animal Ken
Difficulty: (Animal’s Stamina) + (Second animal’s Stamina)
The Scion may combine different animals to create bizarre hybrids, flouting the laws of nature. For every success garnered in addition to the roll’s difficulty, the Scion creates one adult hybrid of her choice (hybrids are always evenly split between males and females; if the number of successes is odd, the extra creature is female). The exact abilities of any given hybrid must be agreed upon by the player and Storyteller. When creating a hybrid from two normal animals, the Scion must pay the 10 Legend cost; when crossing a normal animal with a hybrid, she must pay 15 Legend, and when combining two different hybrids she must pay the 20 Legend cost. Should she wish to combine animals that have previously been enhanced with the Jotunblut or Epic Enhancement Boons, she must pay 25 Legend to reflect the incredibly complicated natures of the creatures involved.
The Scion wishing to use this boon may use it to splice her chosen animal with any other; she does not require any Animal boons for the species she chooses to cross it with.
### PROTEAN UNDERSTANDING ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
No longer restricted to creatures only of his chosen type, the Scion may now apply his Animal Boons to any and all animals.
### TYPHONIAN ANIMAL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 12 Legend, 3 Willpower and 12 lethal damage per use
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Animal Ken
Difficulty: Varies (see below)
After cutting herself and bleeding divine ichor on a specimen of her chosen animal, the Scion may create truly awesome Typhonian beast from her very blood. During the ritual, the creature in question grows to one thousand times its size; all Physical Attributes are multiplied by the creature’s new Legend rating, as are its health boxes. It gains Epic Stamina and Strength equal to its (Legend – 1), has an Accuracy rating of its (Dexterity + 40), and gains an additional soak of 8 aggravated and 16 bashing and lethal. Once created, the creature is permanent unless killed.
|Successes |Beast’s Legend |
|---|---|
|20 Successes |Legend 9 |
|40 Successes |Legend 10 |
|60 Successes |Legend 11 |
|80 Successes |Legend 12 |
### THE BEAST
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion becomes the ultimate Beast, immune to traps and hunters, unshakable from trails, and destructive with a thought.

While anyone can create crafted items or perform in the arts, few have access to the secrets of imbuing true power into their abilities. Only Scions with the Artistry purview may craft relics and magic items; all others are restricted to the mundane.
### FUNDAMENTALS ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon is an instinctive generator, able to channel her own energy into her attempts to create. She may add her total number of Artistry Boons as dice to any Art roll.
### WORK SMARTER ●
**Cost:** 2 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Art (appropriate)
The Scion with this Boon is a master of engineering, so skilled that he instinctively knows all the shortcuts and efficiencies that make a project go more smoothly. Due to his incredible ingenuity, he may create any non-Legendary item in the space of a single scene provided he already has the plans to do so, no matter how long it might take a less talented builder. He may spend this Boon’s cost to complete any creative project, provided that it is no smaller than visible to the naked eye and no larger than a small cottage; items of greater or smaller size require more careful craftsmanship than this Boon can provide.
### POLYMATH ●●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
While all Scions are capable of superhuman artistry, the Scion with this Boon has an instinctive mastery of creation that surpasses anything her rivals might be capable of. Instead of the usual narrow specializations of the Art ability, the Scion now need purchase Art only in the following categories:
|Art |Disciplines |
|---|---|
|Architecture |Buildings, blueprints |
|Culinary |Food, drink, perfumes |
|Engineering |Machinery, engines, mechanics |
|Metalsmithing |Smelting, jewelry, casting |
|Modern |Electronics, plastics |
|Performance |Art, Dance, music, oratory, writing |
|Stonework |Masonry, sculpting, brickwork |
|Textiles |Weaving, sewing, clothing |
|Visual Art |Painting, drawing, photography |
|Woodwork |Carpentry, carving |
Any arts she already possesses automatically convert to these new specialties at the same dot value when she buys this boon. If she has more dots of Arts than can automatically convert, she may spend the additional dots on any of the new Arts she chooses.
### RIVAL READING ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Perception + Art (appropriate)
By studying the handiwork of another artist or craftsman, the Scion with this Boon may learn the ins and outs of her rival’s style and capabilities, reading their secrets through the revelations of their work. If she overcomes her target’s automatic Dexterity + Academics resistance roll, she may deduce the item’s creator’s most skilled Art (if more than one are tied, she learns all of them), level of Epic Intelligence (for an object) or Epic Charisma (for a piece of artwork), and the time and materials that were required to create the item she is studying.
### WORK HARDER ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon knows that no matter how talented the craftsman or brilliant the performer, man-hours will have to be dedicated to any project. As long as she is working on a project or performing an artistic piece, either in planning or building phase, she suffers from no fatigue penalties and requires no sustenance or sleep, enabling her to continue laboring over her inventions for as long as it takes or to act in a forty-eight-hour marathon kabuki play without breaking a sweat. At the end of her labors, all the fatigue penalties she would have suffered during the time she was engaged in her creative pursuits strike at once, often resulting in Scions suddenly dropping unconscious of exhaustion as soon as they finish their most ambitious projects. If the Scion spends Legend on anything else while working or chooses to do anything other than work on her art, she immediately loses the benefits of this Boon and the fatigue penalties are immediately applied.
### CANNIBALIZE ●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon is never without the tools he needs for the task at hand; whatever he finds nearby can be repurposed to fit his needs. By spending the requisite cost and smashing the surface beneath his feet, he can quickly cannibalize the resulting pieces and debris into workable tools for his current project; anything from hammers to screwdrivers to tweezers can be reconstructed from the rubble quickly and easily. He may create all normal, uncomplicated tools he needs for a single project with one use of this Boon, but he may not create anything that requires a power source or has minute or complicated moving parts (he can cobble together a screwdriver, but he can’t make a power drill). The makeshift tools are nigh-indestructible and hold together for the remainder of the scene, after which point the Scion’s strength of will is no longer enough to prevent them from falling apart. A Scion must be currently involved in a creative project that requires these tools in order to create them; he cannot use this Boon to create tools for other people or purposes.
### NECTAR AND AMBROSIA ●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use + 1 Lethal Damage
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Art (Culinary)
The most magical and delicious foodstuffs of the divine world are made by Scions with this Boon, which allows them to harness the energies of their fallen foes or even fellows into hale and hearty fare. By cutting himself and infusing his food with his own blood, the Scion may use the culinary arts to create food or drink that enhances the abilities of those who partake of it. He may grant the magical sustenance to up to as many people as he has Artistry Boons, preparing small portions on up to giant feasts. All those who consume his carefully-brewed tea or expertly-braised steaks gain number of dice equal to the number of dots the scion has in Art (culinary) in one ability (chosen by the GM as appropriate to the source of the food) for the next 24 hours. The magically-created food is expertly made but spoils rapidly, and is only edible for one day after the Scion completes it.
### CURSE OF INEPTITUDE ●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics
Few things annoy a craftsman like a rival competitor, but the Scion with this Boon can hamstring her opposite number, rendering him an inept blunderer and clearing the playing field for her own inventions and creations. By publicly insulting her target’s creative abilities and overcoming his resistance roll, she may levy a dice penalty equal to her total number of Artistry Boons on all rolls he makes to design, build or modify anything. Her target’s newfound clumsiness and confusion last for a number of days equal to her threshold successes, after which point he may once again compete with her without a handicap.
### JURY-RIG ●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon is so ingenious that she may find ways to swap out materials if she finds herself short, making do on a shoestring budget or with only the objects she can find to hand. While working on a project, she may spend the requisite cost to substitute up to a third of a necessary component with a similar other component (i.e., if she had only ten feet of copper wire, she could use a jump-rope to fill out the other three feet) without any loss of functionality. The object replacing a material must be similar in shape and size and must be incorporated into the Scion’s design exactly as if it were the original material required, and the Scion must always have at least two-thirds of the correct material before attempting to jury-rig the remainder with this power. If several components of the Scion’s design are lacking, she may use this power on as many of them as she wishes to pay for. The substituted material remains functional and a permanent part of the Scion’s creation once completed, and the Scion may even make substitutions for magical items with this Boon if she so chooses (i.e., replacing a phoenix feather with a pigeon’s). The Scion may only use this Boon to substitute materials while building a creative project, and cannot use it to increase the amounts of substances or materials he is not using for such a project.
### LULLABYE ●●●●
**Cost:** 4 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Art (Performance)
The Scion with this power may extend his incredible artistry over the subconscious minds of those around him, putting them to sleep as if drugged. By singing or playing an instrument, giving a speech, telling a story or some other kind of performance art for a 2 turn action, he may cause everyone listening to, or watching him to drift quietly off to sleep; the Scion may not choose his targets specifically, but rather affects all those near him. They may resist him with a Stamina + Fortitude roll, but if they fail find themselves becoming drowsy within 1 turn and succumb completely to unconsciousness within two. They remain asleep for a number of hours equal to his total number of Artistry Boons unless they are physically hurt, at which point they immediately wake, disoriented, and are immune to this Boon being used on them again for the remainder of the day.
### SUBLIME SUSPENSION ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Art (Performance)
Performances are usually fleeting things, a few moments of sublime excellence that last only a few minutes or hours, but the Scion with this Boon may preserve her performances long after the time that most would have forgotten them, causing audience after audience to experience her skill anew. By paying this Boon’s activation cost at the time of a performance, the Scion may cause it to become “suspended” at the location that it occurs, thereafter occurring again at the same time each day for anyone to see. She need not be present herself, as anyone present at the designated time will see the performance and all its original performers and features exactly as if they were there, before they vanish, dreamlike, at the end of the show. The Scion’s performance repeats itself for a number of days equal to her successes unless another artistic event attempts to take its place during the time it would normally appear; if the new event garners more successes on a Charisma + Art (Performance) roll than the Scion originally did, it proceeds unmolested that day, but if it is substandard the Scion’s performance overrides it and happens instead, regardless of what the rival show attempts to do. If another performer uses this Boon and gets more successes on its activation roll than the Scion, he may cut her run short and substitute his own long-running art venue.
### FIRE IN THE BELLY ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
The Scion with this Boon is not only a master of creativity and creation; he is so attuned to the interplay of moving parts and complex designs that he may influence and manipulate living beings as if they were his beloved automatons or actors in his plays, giving them exactly the fuel they need to complete specific goals or projects. By giving a speech of at least ten minutes in length, extolling one of the creative Virtues of Endurance, Expression or Intellect, he may cause that Virtue to manifest itself in listeners within earshot equal to his successes, causing his targets to gain two dots (or, if he possesses the Virtue himself, the same rating that he has) of the Virtue for a number of days equal to his total number of Artistry Boons. During that time, the targets are affected by and able to channel the Virtue the same as any other, and once that time is up it dissipates completely. This Boon’s effects may only affect a given target once; if it is used again, whichever use of the Boon had the higher roll takes effect.
### SPEED BUILD ●●●●●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon is simply speedier with her hands than most, able to deftly complete tasks that might take others twice as long. Whenever she makes an extended Art roll in an attempt to create something, she may pay double the normal Legend cost to double her successes on individual rolls within it. This does not double the cost of any resources she might spend to apply Virtue channels.
### ARTISAN OF THE AGES ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon transcends the normal lines between different crafts and specialties; to her, all creation is one, all creative spirit from the same source, and she understands the intricacies of the sciences, the complications of the physical crafts and the ephemeral nature of the performance arts as simple, interconnected facets of the same cosmic creative force. She gains a number of permanent dots of Art equal to her total number of Artistry Boons, in any specializations she wishes, and continues to gain new dots whenever she gains a new Boon in the purview.
### CREATION MEMORY ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** Varies (see below)
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Command
The Scion with this Boon is the eternal mistress of the items she has created, commanding their loyalty no matter how long it has been or who has wielded them in the meantime. Whenever she wishes, she may spend a point of Legend to cause any item or machine she has personally crafted to appear, summoned out of the hands of whoever held it in order to aid her instead. If she calls upon an item she created that has been made into someone else’s Birthright, she must pay five points of Legend and one point of Willpower (if she calls the item from a different plane – i.e., calling an item from the World to an Overworld – both costs are doubled) and overcome its current owner’s Charisma + Occult roll, but once she has done so she may use it as if it were her own Birthright for the remainder of the scene, as it instinctively recognizes its creator. If she wishes to keep using it after the scene in which she uses this Boon, she must use this Boon again in order to do so, or roll against its rating each time as normal. Short of destroying the object, there is no way to prevent the Scion from calling on it if she so chooses; its first loyalty is always to the one who created it.
### TOOL OF FATE ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
By giving up his handiwork to become the tool of Fate, the Scion may create items more quickly and freely than ever before, assisted by the hands of destiny itself. Whenever he wishes, he may decide that the item he is creating is not of his own design but Fate’s, destined to play an important role in future events. If he does so and pays this Boon’s cost, the successes required to both plan and create it are cut in half, demonstrating that the great web of Fate itself wishes him to finish his creation with all due haste.
However, there is a hefty tradeoff for such ease of creation; the new object is destined to play an important role in someone’s Fate in the future, determined by the roll of a single die, and automatically gains an extra relic dot beyond the Scion’s design (whose effects are determined by the GM, appropriate to its new owner). The Scion has no control over what the item’s eventual Fate must be, nor any knowledge of it.
|Die Roll |Object’s Destined Owner |
|---|---|
|9-10 |The Scion |
|7-8 |Someone in the Scion’s band |
|5-6 |A friend or pantheon member of the Scion’s |
|3-4 |An enemy or hostile party of the Scion’s |
|2 |The Scion’s current nemesis |
|1 |A new nemesis who now opposes the Scion |
If the roll is a 5 or higher, the Scion may choose to personally gift the item to its new owner, although if he delays doing so for more than a month, Fate will simply ensure that it arrives at its destination without his help. If he rolls a 4 or lower, the item instantly vanishes upon completion, reappearing with the one who now wields it.
While the ability to create artwork or machines with incredible ease makes this Boon’s use a great temptation, the creative among the gods still use it sparingly and with great caution. All too often, Fate’s design is cruel at the worst moment, and a sword created thus might turn out to be Mistletoe, or a statue might be destined to become unfortunate Pandora.
### FORGERY ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** Varies (see below)
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Larceny
For some Scions, it isn’t necessary to truly understand the inner workings or design of an item to recreate it. By spending two points of Legend per relic dot of an item (to a minimum of two for mundane objects) while touching or holding an object, a Scion may instantly duplicate it into a second one, creating perfect copies and flawless forgeries simply by copying whatever he sees. He must be able to gain a number of successes equal to ten times the number of relic dots the original item possesses; if he does so, the newly-created duplicate is a perfect copy, but if he falls short the copy will be flawed, as detailed below (all relic results are rounded down):
|Difference in Successes |Mundane Results |Relic Results |
|---|---|---|
|0-10 |Item appears perfect but functions poorly |Relic has 1/2 bonuses or capabilites and its powers cost double |
|10-20 |Item appears damaged and functions poorly |Relic has 1/3 bonuses or capabilities and its powers cost triple |
|20-30 |Item bears only vague resemblance to original and does not function at all |Relic has 1/4 bonuses or capabilities and its powers cost four times their usual price |
|31+ |Item is unrecognizable and useless |Relic has 1/10 bonuses or capabilities and its powers cost ten times their usual price |
For example, a Scion might decide to duplicate a famous painting, intent on selling it as the original and making millions of dollars off the forged copy before disappearing with his ill-gotten gain. He spends two points of Legend and gets ten successes on his roll, creating a perfect copy of the Mona Lisa. He hands it off to a dealer and gets out of town before it can expire at the end of the month. On the other hand, a Scion might decide to create a forgery of his bandmate’s seven-dot relic sword, which allows her to channel the Fire purview, shoot blasts of flame at her enemies for sixteen yards in every direction for 3 Legend per attack and add her Legend as dice to all Survival rolls. He must spend fourteen dots of Legend for such an undertaking, and needs 70 successes to succeed, but only manages to roll 55. The resulting forged sword is rusty, pitted, pockmarked and obviously not in great condition, costs 9 Legend per attack to shoot fire for only five yards in any direction, and only grants a third of his Legend rating to Survival rolls.
The new-forged copy is not tied to anyone as a Birthright if it is a relic, and anyone with Epic Perception dots at least equal to the Scion’s level of Artistry is able to identify it as a forgery on sight. The Scion may only duplicate crafted items in this way; he cannot recreate living things or naturally-occurring objects, and he also cannot create forgeries of star-level relics, which are too awesome and complex for mere copycatting. The forged item is still not a true creation, despite its convincing appearance, and degrades and becomes unusable after a number of days equal to the Scion’s total number of Artistry Boons, crumbling to useless dust.
### MYSTICAL MASTERWORK ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The artistic prowess of the Scion with this Boon is so moving that she can affect those who view her creations as if her own formidable personality were at work. Whenever she creates a permanent work of art (a sculpture, jewelry piece, painting or anything else that is not functional and exists purely to be appreciated), she may pay this Boon’s cost and choose any one of the BFF, Calm the Savage, Center of Attention, Instant Seminar, Lasting Impression or Total Recall Knacks that she possesses, paying its cost as well. When she does, she imbues the artwork with that Knack’s powers, causing it to automatically affect all who behold it as if she had used the Knack on them herself. Those who see her majestic artwork may still roll to resist its effects, against a difficulty equal to her relevant Art rating as if it were an Epic Attribute, but if they fail find themselves entranced by the Scion’s artistic mastery. This power works on a given target only the first time they see the Scion’s creation, and adding it to a piece of art adds an additional difficulty of 100 to the roll to create it.
### RECLAMATION ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Perception + Investigation
No matter how perfectly crafted or expertly defended, even masterpieces are sometimes destroyed by disaster or enemies. The Scion with this Boon can’t necessarily prevent her works from being annihilated by truly determined foes or dangerous phenomena, but she does have the ability to salvage what remains afterward, even if her creations have been utterly decimated. Whenever something she created is destroyed, she may salvage two percent of its substance or materials per success from whatever rubble remains, gathering chunks and scraps or even microscopic motes. As long as some substance remains, even melted in lava or dispersed as dust in the air, it responds to its original creator’s call, drawing back together and solidifying in her hands. The recollected substance may be used to rebuild it at a later date; if the Scion uses at least half the same materials when she rebuilds the object, she gains ten additional successes to every roll she makes to create it. If she succeeds in reclaiming the full one hundred percent of the item’s materials, it automatically reforms and is restored as if it were never destroyed.The Scion may only recover materials up to a number of days after destruction equal to her total number of Artistry Boons; after that point, the item has been too long destroyed and its component parts too scattered to regain.
### MARK OF THE MUSE ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower dot per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon may use his incredible artistic talent to inspire lesser artists, pushing them to a greatness they could never have achieved on their own. By spending a Willpower dot and investing his trust in any person of Legend rating 4 or lower, he may act as their muse, giving them access to one of his Arts as if it were their own. The person thus inspired may roll his entire Art pool, regardless of whether or not they would normally be high enough Legend to do so, and while they have access to it the Scion himself is unable to use it, having given all his artistic skill away to another. However, the inspired artist’s new works and feats come from the wellspring of the Scion, and he regains one Willpower every day that his Art is inspiring another, one Virtue channel in Endurance, Expression or Intellect every week (if he does not have any of these Virtues, his entire Willpower pool refills), and one Legendary deed per month. He must have at least six dots of an Art, representing superhuman mastery, in order to inspire someone with it this way, and must declare how long he wishes to give his Art away when he uses this Boon. At the end of that time period, his dots of Art and the permanent dot of Willpower he spent to use this Boon return; he may end the Boon’s effects early at any time if he wishes, but if he does so, the dot of Willpower is lost.
### MYSTERY OF IMHOTEP ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
For projects of truly impressive scope which the Scion cannot hope to complete on her own, she may call upon the power of this Boon to make herself a veritable army of workers to aid her, enhancing them with her own supernatural abilities when it comes to creation. By gathering her workers together, proclaiming the project and exhorting them to do their best to serve its interests, she inspires them to true greatness; when she spends the requisite cost, ten people (of Legend rating 8 or lower) for every success she garners immediately gain dots in all Arts equivalent to her own, which override any lesser levels of Art they might have previously possessed and which they are fully able to use for a number of days equal to her total number of Artistry. While her grand team of workers is marshaled behind her, the Scion’s planning difficulty for the current project is doubled and the difficulty for the building phase is multiplied by ten, but there is no minimum roll for the workers, who may contribute to the final product with every roll as long as they get even a single success. Though the workers are under no onus from this Boon to follow the Scion’s commands, they represent a formidable task force if she keeps them working toward her goal. This Boon only works if the Scion herself remains present and oversees the project personally; if she departs to focus on other things, her workforce finds itself no longer divinely inspired and ceases to be supernaturally effective.
### GEARS OF THE WORLD/MUSIC OF THE SPHERES ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
So accustomed is the Scion to the complicated inner workings of her machines and creations, and so attuned to the awesome music that the universe itself makes as it moves, that she can apply that knowledge to the natural world around her, seeing the movement of the great cogs, instruments and switches of the universe and even of Fate itself. By taking in the vastness of the cosmic machine around her and meditating on its ineffable grandeur, the Scion can accurately predict the future in short bursts, following the motion of the great symphony of Fate to its logical conclusion. When the Scion spends the requisite cost, she may take any one action; after doing so, if the results are not to her taste, she may choose to instead take another action to represent her ability to see the consequences ahead of time through her heightened awareness. She may not take the same action again, but she is free to pay the cost again if she wishes to see the consequences of her second action ahead of time as well. The Scion always sees the immediate results of her action, but may, at the Storyteller’s discretion, be afforded a glimpse into its long-term effects as well. She must choose whether to accept her action or rewind it on the same tick, and cannot wait to see what others might do in the meantime.
### UNCREATION ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
Anything created can be uncreated, and none are more suited to do so than the Scion who built them in the first place. Whenever he chooses, he may decide to uncreate anything he himself fashioned by touching it and concentrating his will on it, ordering it to fall to nothingness once again. When he does so and pays this Boon’s cost, it immediately crumbles and is destroyed, leaving behind nothing but dust and air where once a masterpiece existed. If he successfully uncreates an item, he immediately regains an amount of Legend as the energies of his creation return home to their origin; if the relic was one to five dots, he regains triple its rating in Legend, and if it was six to ten, he regains five times its rating. Star-level relics cannot be uncreated, since they have become forces of Legend in their own right, and he also cannot uncreate a relic that has been bound to someone else as a Birthright (although he may prevail upon a mage to attempt to unbind it from them first). Once an object has been destroyed in this way, it cannot be restored, even by the Reclamation Boon.
### BREATH OF LIFE ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend, 2 Willpower and 1 lethal damage per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Empathy
The Scion with this Boon blurs the line between creator and god, turning cold stone, lifeless machinery and unliving art into breathing, conscious creatures. He may give life to any creation of his own, no matter what size or level of complication, by spilling his own blood and incorporating it into the object as a permanent divine power. Once he has done so, the formerly inanimate and inert object comes to life, becoming permanently possessed of consciousness and free will, able to think and act within the confines of its design. It possesses Intelligence and Epic Intelligence equal to its relic rating (if it is not a relic, it has a single dot of Intelligence) as well as five dots in whatever abilities the Storyteller deems appropriate, and may communicate if equipped with appropriate hardware or design (a speaker, a mouth, the ability to beep Morse code or anything else) as well as gaining the ability to speak telepathically to its creator. While the object is alive, it does not gain the ability to travel; it can move if its design allows (for example, a statue might move its arms and speak, or a computer might move its mouse to perform operations), but it cannot go anywhere. Once the Scion has breathed life into his creation, it is permanently alive unless it is physically destroyed.
### EX NIHILO ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Art (appropriate)
All the powers of creation reside within the Scion with this Boon, who may now call up new works of art and complex mechanical items full-formed from the empty void. Whenever he chooses to create something and successfully completes his planning phase, he may pay this Boon’s cost to create it from nothing, needing no materials and spending no time on actually crafting it. He must get a number of successes on his activation roll equivalent to those he would need if he were actually physically building the item and cannot create any relic of more than five dots, but once he has done so, he molds it from literal nothingness, calling it into being through sheer force of will. Objects created thusly are as solid, enduring and real as if they had been made normally, despite their awe-inspiring origins.
### THE CREATOR
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion becomes the Creator, an unstoppable, unflagging being of pure creative energy; nothing cannot be made by the Creator, nor can anything refuse to be turned toward her creative purpose.
## CHAOS
|Boon |Level |Cost |Roll |Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Eye of the Storm |● |1L |— |Avoid effects and damage from chaotic events. |
|Murphy’s Law |● |1L |— |Cause small, nonlethal things to start going wrong for everyone in your area (including you). |
|Hornet’s Nest |●● |1L |Int + Awa |Add or subtract dice of damage dealt from chaotic sources. |
|Paralyzing Confusion |●●● |1W |Wit + Emp |Cause your target to lose short-term memory and become immobilized by chaotic confusion. |
|Persistent Echo |●●● |1L |Man + Occ |Cause all sound in a scene to combine into an impenetrable wall of noise. |
|Impassion |●●●● |Varies |Man + Emp |Increase your target’s current emotions to passionate intensity. |
|Out of the Frying Pan |●●●● |3+L + 1W |— |Escape from the current situation to a random destination. |
|Sabot |●●●● |1W |Int + Art |Break or severely impair the function of machines. |
|Labyrinthine Lingering |●●●●● |3L |Wit + Awa |Cause others to be unable to find their way out of a crossroads. |

|Crawling Chaos |●●●●● ● |3L + 1W |Wit + Emp |Cause your target and anyone who sees or touches him to be paralyzed by overwhelming confusion. |
|Friendly Fire |●●●●● ● |3L |Man + Pol |Cause your target’s next attack to strike someone on their own side instead of an enemy. |

|Unintended Purpose |●●●●● ●●●●● |10L + 1W |Wit + Com |Use any item as if it were another item of a similar size. |
|The Void |●●●●● ●●●●● ● |30L + 1W |— |Cause mass insanity, reform reality around you and completely rewrite the personalities and natures of beings near you. |
### EYE OF THE STORM ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon (which may be activated reflexively at any time) is perpetually surrounded by calm, untouched by chaos occurring around him; he cannot be affected by chaotic events such as riots or stampedes, and undirected missiles such as shrapnel or randomly aimed bullets simply fail to hit him for the remainder of the scene. This Boon has no effect on attacks that are intended for the Scion, however.
### MURPHY’S LAW ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon may choose to simply unleash chaos around him, and damn the consequences. Everything that can go wrong in the scene suddenly begins going wrong – machines break, things are dropped and lost, assistants forget crucial reports, the plumbing ruptures, tires go flat, and any number of other things suddenly go haywire. While nothing life-threatening or seriously injurious happens as a result of these sudden malfunctions, the situation is incredibly frustrating, taxing, and distracting for all those involved, which may afford the Scion time for an escape, a covert operation, or just to sit back and enjoy the fun. Even the Scion himself is not immune to the chaos around him (unless he also uses the Eye of the Storm Boon), and will be subjected to just as many difficulties as everyone else, though he has the advantage of knowing this ahead of time. Things continue to go wrong until the end of the scene (when, although they may stop actively going wrong, things are certainly not guaranteed to suddenly right themselves, either).
### HORNET’S NEST ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Awareness
Due to her ability to analyze and augment the chaos around her, the Scion with this power may add or subtract bonus dice equal to her successes to any damage coming from a random or chaotic source, at her discretion.
### PARALYZING CONFUSION ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Empathy
The Scion with this power causes instant, overwhelming confusion to his target, rendering them unable to speak, act, or think coherently for the remainder of the scene, or until he or she is dealt damage, at which point they instantly snap out of their gibbering inactivity. Once released from it, the target will have no memory of the episode or of events for the same number of turns before he or she was affected, and may be targeted again if the Scion wishes to spend the Boon’s cost again.
### PERSISTENT ECHO ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Occult
The Scion with this power causes herself to be surrounded by indecipherable white noise. Sounds switch and intermingle until they are no longer recognizable, and communication via speech in her presence is impossible. The wall of noise lasts for the scene and follows the Scion wherever she may go, and may be resisted by an opposed Perception + Awareness roll.
### IMPASSION ●●●●
**Cost:** 1+ Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy
With a word, a touch, or even just a knowing smirk, the Scion may enhance the emotions of another person, pushing them far past their current level. If the Scion overcomes her target’s resistance roll, his strongest emotion at that particular moment will shoot through the roof, becoming much more intense and uncontrollable than would be usual for the situation. The Scion need spend only a point of Legend to affect less powerful beings, but must expend considerably more energy to affect those of higher Legend ratings, as follows:
|Target’s Legend Rating |Legend Cost |
|---|---|
|1-4 |1 |
|5-8 |3 |
|9-12 |7 |
If the target thus affected needs to roll a Virtue at any time during the scene, he or she rolls double her usual number of dice; the target may also double the dice received from Virtue channels while thus affected.
### OUT OF THE FRYING PAN ●●●●
**Cost:** 3+ Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon has no compunctions about throwing himself on the mercy of chance. Whenever the Scion finds himself facing insurmountable danger (or he just wants a change of scenery), he may pay the requisite cost to instantly teleport himself (and as many other people as he likes, provided that he spends one additional point of Legend for each) away and to a random destination of Fate’s choosing. He has no control over where he goes or what is happening when he arrives, or even over whether or not he will be in more danger than he started in; he simply rolls one die and arrives at a destination as follows:
|Roll Result |Destination |
|---|---|
|10 |Scion’s home |
|9 |Friendly Terra Incognita |
|8 |Scion’s pantheon’s underworld or Axis Mundi |
|7 |Large but friendly metro area |
|6 |Small, safe city or town |
|5 |Isolated, dangerous wilderness |
|4 |Extremely hostile, imminently dangerous place |
|3 |Hostile underworld or Axis Mundi |
|2 |Hostile Terra Incognita |
|1 |Location of dangerous mortal enemy |
If the Scion rolls a 1 and has used this power to escape an enemy or dangerous situation, the new enemy or situation is automatically a more dangerous one; if he has no other mortal enemy, Fate will invent a new one for him. While this power does afford the Scion the ability to move between different planes without use of the Psychopomp purview, its element of random chance and probable danger make it impractical for such uses… for all but the most foolhardy or die-hard of gamblers.
### SABOT ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art (related)
This Boon causes a machine that the Scion is looking at to spontaneously break, rendering it dead or with very limited functionality. The Scion must be able to see the machine he wishes to sabotage, and, in the case of very large, complex machines, may need to break more than one submachine in order to render the entire thing unusable. If the machine was created by a Legendary person or being, the Scion must garner more successes on his activation roll than the creator did on their original Dexterity + Art roll; if he wishes, he may spend one point of Willpower to roll again in an extended roll as many times he wishes until he has managed to break the machine in question. Conversely, anyone wishing to fix the machine after the Scion has broken it must receive more successes on a Dexterity + Art roll than the Scion received when he broke it.
### LABYRINTHINE LINGERING ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + AWareness
By standing at any crossroads or forking of the way, the Scion with this boon may trap and disorient others by causing them to have no idea which path is which. This power is reflexively resisted with a Perception + Awareness roll, even for those with no Legend rating. While the Scion must be present at the crossroads to activate this Boon, he need not remain there once he has done so; the power remains for a number of days equal to his activation successes.
### RECURRING DISTRACTION ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per point of penalty
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Empathy
The Scion with this Boon may distract and irritate others by lodging a small, repetitive idea in their skulls; it might be anything from a commercial jingle to a bit of a speech (a good pun is its own reword!), but no matter what it is it is sure to be annoying, intrusive, and completely unshakable. For the next number of days equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, a target unable to resist the Scion’s powers will suffer a penalty equal to however many Legend she chose to spend upon activation (up to a maximum equal to her total number of Chaos Boons) to all rolls.
### CRAWLING CHAOS ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Empathy
The Scion with this power may reduce targets to shivering, twitching balls of confusion, unable even to speak or act on their own for the remainder of the scene. This malady is instantly communicated to anyone who sees or touches the affected target, at which point the new target is fully gripped by the same misfortune. If a target thus affected is physically harmed, they immediately become active and aware again, shaking off the Scion’s influence (though seeing someone else affected could easily plunge them back into it). Upon emerging from his or her catatonic state, the target has no memory of the episode, nor of an equal amount of time before he or she was affected.
### FRIENDLY FIRE ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Politics
By concentrating and directing the forces of chaos toward a particular target, the Scion can cause them to suddenly act in a completely unforeseen way, turning on friends and allies. By waiting until his target takes an action (the Scion himself must not be taking any other actions, waiting for the perfect moment to strike) and spending the requisite cost at the same moment, the Scion redirects their action, whatever it might be, onto a random friendly person or creature in their vicinity; the target immediately takes whatever action he or she was about to take, but directs it at the friendly being unless they are able to overcome the Scion’s successes on a Wits + Integrity roll. Warriors turn to cleave their comrades, healers mend flesh that has no need of it, and spellcasters find themselves sowing curses and confusion among their allies, completely by accident; targets thus affected by the Scion’s whims have no warning of their imminent failure and merely believe that they have catastrophically missed or mistargeted without meaning to. The Scion may use this Boon only once per scene on any one being, though he may use it on as many different people in a scene as he wishes to pay for. If the Scion is facing only one foe and there are no available allies or bystanders for them to target, this Boon has no effect.
### BACCHANALIA ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Art (must be a form of performance)
The Scion with this Boon causes a sudden, hedonistic revel to break out all around her, throwing inhibitions to the wind and encouraging everyone affected to indulge in whatever pleasures present themselves. Everyone within a radius equal to 100 times the Scion’s total number of Chaos Boons in yards is affected, and will be prone to drinking, dancing, wild sex, and any other form of abandon that may suggest itself. The Scion’s hedonistic influence lasts for a number of hours equal to the Scion’s total number of Chaos Boons, after which it vanishes completely, usually leaving a lot of very confused and mortified people in its wake. Once the Scion’s powers dissipate, those affected lose their entire Willpower pool; for the next week, they may only regain up to half their normal pool of Willpower as the shame of their actions assails them.
### INSTANT RIOT ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence
By inciting a small group of people to rebellion, the Scion may cause a riot to break out, even in the most sedate and uninspired countryside hamlet. Five people are inspired to riot for every success scored on the Scion’s activation roll, and the riot (which continues to expand as long as this Boon is in effect) lasts for a number of hours equal to the Scion’s total number of Chaos Boons. Once the Scion’s powers dissipate, the rioters lose their entire Willpower pool for the next week as the shame of their actions assails them. While beings with a Legend rating cannot be incited to riot with this Boon, they may be injured by the rioters and the general chaos around them; if they possess more Chaos Boons than the Scion, they may avoid the riot’s effects with the Eye of the Storm Boon.
### INSANITY ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy
The Scion may cause instant, frothing insanity in others with the use of this Boon, destroying their ability to think and act rationally and consigning them to madness. She may affect a number of people equal to her total number of Chaos Boons, plus the same again for every point of Legend she spends past 5. Creatures with Legend 0 to 4 become permanently insane and cannot be brought back to sanity; those with Legend 5 to 8 are affected for a number of days equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, while those of Legend 9 or above are affected for mere hours. Those affected have no memory of their period of insanity once they return to normal.
### SYSTEM FAILURE ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art (related)
Instead of specifically concentrating on a particular machine, the Scion’s mere presence is now so discombobulating that it causes mass instability and failure in all machines and systems around him. When he spends the requisite cost, the Scion causes all nearby mechanical and electronic systems and constructs to instantly malfunction or break, turning from useful tools to useless heaps of slag in moments; all machines within ten times the Scion’s successes in yards are affected, rendering entire factories and neighborhoods functionally destroyed in a matter of seconds. Mundane machines break automatically; machines magically constructed or enhanced are more difficult, and the Scion must evenly divide his successes between any that are in the area, attempting to overcome their creators’ rolls simultaneously in order to damage them. Once destroyed, would-be repairmen must gain more than the Scion’s activation successes on a Dexterity + Art roll in order to restore them.
### UNLIKELY PATTERN ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower and (1/3 difficulty) of Legend
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Art
Difficulty: Varies (see below)
The Scion with this Boon may create order out of random elements, just as he is able to create chaos from structure. By collecting various items and throwing them into the air, the Scion may cause them to fall to the ground in the perfect form of something else; for example, he might throw some metal and rubber into the air and watch a bicycle drop to the floor, or toss a bag of food staples upward and enjoy some fresh bread when it tumbles down. As he is calling on the capricious whims of chaos to create something, the Scion may easily create either a flawless item or a misshapen, damaged one; if the result of his activation roll is an even number, the item is perfect, while an odd number yields a serious flaw. Every threshold success past those required to create the item may be applied toward some desirable trait (e.g. soak, speed, appearance, etc).
|Items |Finished Item |Difficulty |
|---|---|---|
|Wooden blocks |Stack of blocks |3 |
|Coins |All heads or all tails |5 |
|Aluminum, rubber, chain |Bicycle |10 |
|Coins |All edges |15 |
|Flour, milk, eggs |Cake |20 |
|Steel, plastic, glass |Car |25 |
|Dark matter |Pocket universe |50 |
The item is fully formed and functional for the remainder of the scene, after which it falls into its constituent parts again; if the Scion wishes to make it permanent, he may spend a permanent dot of Willpower to do so.
### UNINTENDED PURPOSE ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Command
The world is the Scion’s playground, one on which he is king, god, and main character of his own story when he possesses this Boon, which allows him to use any item as though it were any other item of a similar size. Footballs may become grenades, grenades may become pineapples, and pineapples may become high-tech notebook computers at the drop of a hat. The transformed item remains in its new form for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, after which it reverts to its original state.
### THE VOID
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion becomes a force of raw chaos, destroying and reshaping life and matter around him and warping the natures and personalities of even gods and titans.

### NIGHT EYES ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon may see perfectly through complete darkness; he can distinguish outlines and objects with no trouble, though he cannot see colors. Faint light sources do not impede this perfect vision, but if there is a strong light source (anything brighter than a single candle) he will only be able to see as well as that light source would normally allow.
### AFRAID OF THE DARK ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy
The Scion may show the darkness of the abyss for a small moment, so terrifying her target that she instantly loses a point of Willpower. The target loses an additional point of Willpower for every three threshold successes past the first the Scion receives.
### SHADOW MASK ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Larceny
By covering his face in a wreath of impenetrable shadows, the Scion may become unrecognizable, even under the brightest of lights. Others may attempt to penetrate the shadow disguise by receiving more successes on a Perception + Awareness roll than the Scion scored upon activation. The disguise remains for 24 hours, even if the Scion is rendered unconscious during that time, and affects surveillance equipment and other machines as well as direct vision; it can only be seen through by someone possessing the Night Eyes Boon.
### SHADOW REFUGE ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion may hide herself completely in any shadow large enough to cover her entire body; while she is thus concealed, any mortal or mundane attempts to detect her fail automatically, and supernatural hunters are forced to roll Perception + Awareness to attempt to locate her. The Scion adds the number of Darkness Boons she possesses as automatic successes to any Dexterity + Stealth roll made to elude them. Those possessing the Night Eyes Boon are unaffected by this power.
### ABSORB LIGHT ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon draws light into himself and snuffs it out, becoming a walking void of blackness. He may add his total number of Darkness Boons as automatic successes to any Stealth roll, and is immune to any light-based damage, such as infrared bursts or nuclear fallout. Anyone attempting to affect him with a Boon from the Sun purview while this power is active must successfully roll their total number of Sun Boons against his total number of Darkness Boons, or fail automatically. He may be instantly perceived, however, by anyone possessing the Night Eyes boon.
### SHADOW STEP ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
No longer confined to normal movement, the Scion with this power may step into any shadow large enough to conceal her entire body and step out of any other one, so long as the destination shadow is within sight.
### CONSUME SHADOW ●●●●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Survival
The Scion with this Boon may draw sustenance from the shadows around her, gaining strength and healing damage by ingesting them as she would food. The shadows thus eaten can only be those of inanimate objects and remain gone for a number of days equal to the Scion’s successes, lowering the Scion’s available options and causing considerable interest or distress amongst those that might notice the phenomenon. The Scion heals a number of damage boxes depending on the side of the consumed shadow.
### SHADOW CRAFT ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival
Difficulty: Varies (see below)
The Scion with this Boon may manipulate shadows as if they were concrete, malleable things, shaping and changing them as he chooses. As long as he is touching a shadow, he may bend, break, or otherwise change its shape in any way he wishes, even extending it past the point where light would normally dispel it (though he cannot increase it or shrink it past its original surface area). Once he has changed it, the shadow remains in its new shape and location for a number of hours equal to his successes, no matter what changes in surface or light source might occur afterward. Alternatively, the Scion may create simple items or weapons from the very darkness around him. Upon activating this Boon, he must choose whether he would like to make his item more refined or make it last longer; his threshold successes are equal to a number of days if he chooses to make his item last longer, or to either accuracy or soak (up to a maximum bonus of his total number of Darkness Boons) if he chooses to make it more refined. These items may be handed off and used by other people, but should any person who does not possess the Night Eyes Boon attempt to use an item created with Shadow Craft, they receive -5 to all their rolls as they cannot accurately perceive the item they are trying to use.
|Item Size |Successes Required |
|---|---|
|Small (arrow, rope, knife, sling) |1 Success |
|Medium (sword, club, bag) |2 Successes |
|Large (staff, oar, footlocker) |3 Successes |
|Oversized (chair, bench, door) |4 Successes |
|Vehicle (boat, hang-glider) |6 Successes |
### SHADOW BOXER ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend per attack
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Brawl
The Scion with this Boon uses an opponent’s own inseparable shadow as a formidable weapon against them; by spending the requisite cost, she may cause a target’s shadow to turn on them and attack them as if it were a physical being (a 6-tick attack). The shadow attack cannot be dodged as the shadow is attached to the target, and deals bashing damage equal to the Scion’s successes; this damage, while unavoidable, is considered armor-piercing and may still be soaked as normal.
### SHADOW SHROUD ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Integrity
The Scion may create a pitch-black area for a radius of up to five times his successes in yards, and maintain it for as long as he remains within it. Only direct sunlight may decrease its size and intensity, shrinking it by 10 yards for every hour the light beats down on it. If anyone within that radius is attempting to use any Sun Boon, he may roll his total number of Darkness Boons against their total number of Sun Boons, and if successful may immediately cancel the effects of the Sun Boon. Because of the obscuring shadow, anyone attempting to use Stars Boons while within the Scion’s range must roll against an additional difficulty equal to twice his total number of Darkness Boons in order to perceive the stars.
### HEART OF DARKNESS ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Empathy
The Scion with this Boon is able to cast darkness even into the souls of her victims, sowing doubt and overturning hearts into shadow. By paying the requisite cost and overcoming her target’s resistance roll, the Scion causes their Virtues to invert, turning the most battle-hardened of warriors into cowards and the most noble of lawbringers into inveterate criminals. The Scion immediately inverts her target’s lowest Virtue (if two Virtues are tied for lowest, one is chosen at random); for every five threshold successes she scores past the first, she may invert the next lowest Virtue, until she has changed all of them if she has the ability. Each Virtue affected by the Scion causes the target to behave in exact opposition to its normal tenets, inducing Virtue Extremities for behavior that would normally be in line with it and rewarding behavior that runs counter to the target’s usual nature. Targets with a Legend rating of eight or lower are affected for a number of weeks equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, after which they revert to normal; targets with a Legend rating of nine or higher are affected for the same number of days. Mortals, who typically have no Virtues, instead gain a dot in a random Dark Virtue for every five additional successes the Scion scores, and they retain it permanently. Only a successful use of the Tranquility Boon can snap a target thus overshadowed by the Scion out of their new-found reversal.
### SHADOW BODIES ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Presence
For every five successes she receives on her roll, the Scion may wrap any shadow large enough to contain her body around herself and create a shadow duplicate of herself, capable of acting under her command. The duplicates thus created retain all of the Scion’s mundane physical attributes and abilities, add her total number of Darkness Boons as automatic successes to all their dice pools and may wield items created with Shadow Craft with impunity; they must all perform roughly the same action (if they are attacking, this is considered an automatic coordinated assault) and may not act independently, though that action need not be the same as the Scion’s, and they must avoid direct sunlight, taking one unsoakable lethal damage every ten seconds that they are exposed to it (they are, however, completely immune to bashing damage). If the Scion has activated the Absorb Light Boon previously in the scene, they become immune to the effects of light and may exist in it with impunity. Those wishing to distinguish between the Scion and her duplicates are unable to do so unless they possess the Night Eyes Boon. The doubles remain until the end of the scene or until they leave the Scion’s line of sight, at which point they cease to exist.
### SHADOW PLUNDER ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Command
The Scion with this Boon may wreak social havoc on those he dislikes by entirely removing their shadow, leaving them unsettling and subconsciously disturbing even to the most oblivious of associates. The target thus affected receives a penalty equal to the Scion’s total number of Darkness Boons in automatic successes to all social rolls for a period of days equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, as others are too spooked by his or her otherworldly failure to cast a shadow. In addition, the Scion may use the plundered shadow for his own gain, gaining bonus dice equal to the target’s total number of dots of social Epic Attributes to all social rolls for the same period of time, as he draws on their presence through the conduit of the shadow. Targets who possess the Darkness purview are unaffected, as they cannot be parted from their inherent shadow so easily.
### STRIKE BLIND ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Medicine
The Scion with this Boon may call blackness forth to blind her foes, rendering them completely unable to see. Mortals and animals are permanently blinded, while any creature with Legend a Legend rating of 1 to 8 loses their sight for a number of days equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, and any being with Legend 9 to 12 loses it for the same number of hours. The Scion may affect a number of people equal to her total number of Darkness Boons, plus the same number again for every additional point of Legend she chooses to spend past the first five; every target may resist with a Stamina + Fortitude roll to attempt to retain their sight.
### OUBLIETTE ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Wits + Thrown
By gaining control of a grapple, the Scion may hurl her opponent into the abyss, trapping them forever in an insensible world of blackness and silence. The Scion attempting to thus rid herself of an opponent must first successfully grapple him or her with a Strength or Dexterity + Brawl roll and win both the ensuing contested grapple roll and their automatic resistance roll against her activation successes in order to fling them unwillingly into the void. It is possible to rescue a being trapped in the formless endlessness of night; the attempted rescuer must spend this Boon’s activation cost and reach into the void to drag them back out, and if the would-be rescuer is not the Scion who originally condemned the target to the abyss, he or she must overcome the Scion’s successes on a Perception + Investigation roll to attempt to find the hapless victim.
### ECLIPSE ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Integrity
No longer confined to the smaller effects of lesser Darkness powers, the Scion with this Boon may cause a massive shroud of darkness to fall, swallowing light and keeping any but the most determined of hunters from finding anything. Impenetrable darkness falls over everything in a radius equal to five miles for every success the Scion receives on her activation roll, and lasts for a number of hours equal to her successes unless she chooses to end it; it is unaffected by even the most direct sunlight.
### THE ABYSS
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
The Scion becomes a living embodiment of darkness, blinding and engulfing all in her path.

### DEATH SENSES ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this boon has a supernatural awareness of the dead and may see, hear, and smell ghosts and dead spirits as if they were alive; he may also determine the general cause of death if confronted with a corpse, though this information will be vague. He may turn this power on and off at will (and must announce to the GM that he is doing so).
### DELAY ROT ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Medicine
By touching a corpse, the Scion may perfectly preserve it, protecting it from the ravages of decay for a number of weeks equal to her successes; if the body is not otherwise protected, it will resume rotting at a normal rate once that time has expired.
### CORPSE ORACLE ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
The Scion with this boon may command even the dead to give up their secrets. For every three successes she receives on the activation roll, she may ask any ghost, corpse, or undead creature one question, which it will answer truthfully to the best of its ability. Undead creatures may roll to resist, but will believe themselves to be giving up the information willingly if they fail.
### EUTHANASIA ●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
With a touch, the Scion may administer a merciful death to any incapacitated person or creature. Mortals and normal animals may be killed regardless of their wishes; creatures and people with Legend ratings must genuinely want to die in order for this power to be effective.
### DESTROY DEAD ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
By touching any corpse, body part or other physical evidence of a dead being, the Scion may instantly and utterly destroy it, leaving behind nothing but dust and preventing anyone from using any Death Boons on it again. If a corpse is dismembered, only the part the Scion touches is destroyed, though he may stack the pieces together in order to destroy them all at once.
### UNQUIET CORPSE ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
The Scion with this boon may command the dead to rise and serve him, animating any corpse into a zombie that follows his orders to the best of its ability. The zombies thus raised continue to serve the Scion indefinitely, until they are destroyed or the Scion himself dies. Once the Scion has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements (applied to the zombie template from Scion: Hero) as follows:
|Successes |Enhancement |
|---|---|
|1 Success |+1 Stamina |
|2 Successes |+1 Strength |
|3 Successes |+1 Dexterity or +1 Epic Stamina |
|4 Successes |+1 Legend or +1 Epic Strength |
|5 Successes |+1 Epic Dexterity |
The Scion’s new zombies may have a maximum number of points of Strength and Stamina equal to their Legend multiplied by 5.
### POLTERGEIST BEACON ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend, 1 Willpower and 1 lethal damage per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Occult
The Scion with this Boon may cause an enemy to become perpetually haunted by malevolent spirits, ruining their peace of mind and possibly even placing them in real danger. By placing a drop of her own blood somewhere on her target, the Scion makes the unlucky person into an irresistibly attractive beacon for poltergeists, angry ghosts and mischievous spirits, who will plague him or her incessantly with pranks, noises, and possibly even mildly harmful attacks, all of which may inflict a -4 distraction penalty on the target without warning. The beacon remains in effect for a number of weeks equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, after which point it fades and the ghosts are free to move on as they wish.
### SUMMON GHOST ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult
Provided that he has an item that once belonged to the spirit in question, or can make contact with a living relative, the Scion may summon a ghost to him. While the Scion may force the ghost to come to him if he overcomes its resistance roll, he cannot force it to do anything else without the use of other Death Boons.
### COMMAND THE SOUL ●●●●●
**Cost:** 5+ Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
Though most Scions who seek to master death have long ago learned the trick of creating mindless zombie servants to do their bidding, the Scion with this Boon now wields even greater power, becoming able to exert his control over all types of undead creatures, whether he created them or not. By spending the requisite cost (plus one additional point of Legend for every additional creature he wishes to affect, up to a maximum of his total number of Death Boons) and speaking to any undead being in a commanding voice, forcing it to recognize his authority over death, the Scion may cause it to obey his commands if it fails to resist him, becoming loyal to him as its rightful lord for the remainder of the scene. The undead creature, whether it be a zombie, mummy, ghost or other denizen of the beyond, retains any reasoning capacity and free will it might previously have had; it simply considers the Scion its lord and master for the rest of the scene and follows his instructions to the best of its ability. At the end of the scene, any undead thus enslaved by the Scion come to their senses, and he must convince them of his sovereignty anew if he wishes to continue to enjoy their obedience. If the Scion attempts to take control of an undead creature currently in the employ of another, he and the creature’s current controller make a contested roll of Charisma + Command; if the Scion wins, he retains unarguable control of the creature until his opponent spends to use this Boon and try to wrest it away again, and similarly, if he fails to overcome his opponent’s roll, he must use this Boon again for a second attempt.
### MOTHER’S TOUCH ●●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
Now so attuned to the spirit world that she can move in and out of it herself, the Scion may touch and interact with ghosts as though they were corporeal and alive, even if they have not chosen to manifest physically; while this Boon is active, she is surrounded by a flickering black radiance, indicating her presence in both spheres. If she chooses to attack or otherwise interact with someone who is possessed by a ghost, she must roll separately for both the ghost and the mortal vessel it currently inhabits.
### BLEAK CENSUS ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Perception + Occult
The veil of death is an impenetrable wall of mystery, a barrier that no one may peek behind except for the Scion with this Boon. By naming or specifically describing any one person (the Scion must have a good idea of who he is searching for) and spending the requisite cost, the Scion instantly learns whether or not that person is among the dead. If this Boon reveals that the individual in question is, indeed, deceased, the Scion may ask one question about their death or current disposition or whereabouts among the dead for every five successes he gained on the activation roll. This Boon cannot answer questions having to do with what the individual did in life, nor can it answer questions having to do with their private thoughts or future; it can only provide information concerning their death and afterlife.
### EXORCISM ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult
The Scion with this boon may counteract the meddling of the dead, forcing them back whence they came. By touching a possessed person, he may force the possessing spirit out; likewise, he may banish a ghost back to the Underworld by touching its incorporeal flesh and overcoming its Strength + Athletics resistance roll (a ghost thus banished to the Underworld may not leave it again in any way for a number of days equal to his threshold successes). He may also force one dead or undead creature away from him for every three successes he receives on his activation roll, forcing ghosts to become incorporeal and all dead creatures to give him a berth equal to ten times his total number of Death Boons in yards for a number of hours also equal to his total number of Death Boons.
### HAUNTED MISTS ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
By concentrating and becoming unmoving and inactive for a number of turns equal to half her total number of Death Boons, the Scion may create a thick mist around her, extending for yards equal to her Death Boons in every direction. Any ghosts caught in the mist are unable to leave, and become corporeal for the duration of the scene, giving them both the power to affect their environment and, in turn, the power to be affected.
### SHAMBLING HORDE ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult
The dead now rise at the Scion’s command, even if he does not have the time to specifically dedicate his attention to each one of them. By calling out to the dead and spending the requisite cost, the Scion may cause a number of corpses up to his total number of Death Boons to rise at his command as zombie minions, mindless and under his complete control as if they had been raised individually with the Unquiet Corpse Boon. He may divide his successes in order to decide their capabilities exactly as in the Unquiet Corpse Boon, and his choices are applied to all of the risen zombies instead of just to one. The Scion may only raise zombies if there are enough dead bodies nearby to answer his call; if not, he will be able to raise only as many as are available.
### OPEN UNDERWORLD PORTAL ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Dexterity + Occult
The Scion with this Boon may go directly to the realm of death itself, opening a portal to a relatively safe area in his own pantheon’s Underworld. He may bring a number of others along with him equal to his successes, but any creature with a Legend rating of less than 3 that accompanies him will remain trapped there as a ghost. If he wishes to travel to another pantheon’s Underworld, he may do so instead, but at an additional +10 difficulty to his roll. If the Scion owns an area within an underworld and travels directly to it, he may take twice as many people with him as he would normally be able to.
### GHOST CONTROL ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult
Provided that she has an item that once belonged to the spirit in question and was harvested from the ghost’s body within 24 hours of its death, the Scion may issue commands to a ghost which it has no choice but to obey. She may speak any commands into the item, which instantly transmits them to the ghost; likewise, any communication from the ghost whispers from the memento for the Scion’s ears only. Should the ghost succeed in resisting the Scion’s commands, it will still be required to complete its orders, but it may intentionally pervert or undermine the spirit and goal of those orders while still nominally obeying. If she wishes, the Scion may place the item into a corpse and spend two points of Legend to bind the ghost to that body, causing it to rise as a Hungry Corpse; if she can induce a mortal to swallow the item, she may spend two points of Legend to allow the ghost to possess the mortal’s body, remaining in control of it until the item passes. Whenever the ghost is in actual danger, its item begins to glow with a faint warmth, alerting the Scion to its peril; if it is destroyed, the item vanishes as well. If at any time she wishes to force her ghost to manifest, the Scion may spend three points of Legend; when she does so, the ghost becomes fully solid and corporeal for the remainder of the scene, and must interact with the material world. Should the Scion no longer wish to retain the ghost as a servant, she may devour the item that binds it to her, destroying the spirit in order to gain five Legend points; if she does not, it remains a focal binding point for the ghost for a number of years equal to the Scion’s total number of Death Boons multiplied by the number of years the ghost lived its mortal life. If the Scion retains the ghost’s services for one full year, she may gain ten Legend points from devouring its item, provided that she did not at any point during that time release the ghost’s tie to it. Only the ghosts of mortals may be thus harnessed; those with Legend continue to be subject to the whims of Fate even after death, and may not be chained by any Scion.
### REVENANT ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Stamina + Command
No longer limited to mindless drudges, the Scion with this boon may command the dead to rise and serve him as thinking, intelligent servants, creating undead creatures with their souls intact. The creatures thus created may be in any undead form the Scion considers appropriate (mummies, intelligent zombies, etc.) and continue to serve him loyally and indefinitely upon being created, until they are destroyed or the Scion himself dies. Once the Scion has rolled, he may use his total successes to purchase any combination of enhancements (applied to the Hungry Corpse template from Scion: Hero) as follows:
|Successes |Enhancement |
|---|---|
|1 Success |+1 physical Attribute |
|2 Successes |+1 mental Attribute |
|3 Successes |+1 social Attribute |
|4 Successes |+1 Legend or +1 physical Epic Attribute |
|5 Successes |+1 social or mental Epic Attribute |
The Scion’s newly-created minions may never have an Epic Attribute higher than is proscribed by their Legend rating or mundane Attributes, and they may never possess a higher Legend rating than one lower than the Scion’s own.
### DEATH OF THE SOUL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 20 Legend and 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Occult
The Scion with this Boon has such control over mortality that he may inflict it even on the gods themselves. If the Scion is successful in overcoming his target’s automatic Stamina + Fortitude roll, the god, demigod or other lesser immortal in question becomes mortal for an amount of time (if the target is Legend 1-4, days; if they are Legend 5-8, minutes, and for those Legend 9 and above, turns) equal to the Scion’s threshold successes, losing access to all their godly powers and enhancements. The target may pay two points of Legend and a point of Willpower to reduce the duration of his or her mortality by one unit (and may do so as many times as he or she is willing to pay for). This power cannot be used on gods who are Avatar form, and can never be used on Titan Avatars.
### STRIKE DEAD/DENY DEATH ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Occult
The Scion with this Boon has the ultimate power over life and death, and may instantly cause the death of any creature of Legend 8 or lower provided she overcomes their Stamina + Fortitude roll. She may also, at her discretion, command the dead to rise again, resurrecting a fallen creature or comrade from the grave; to do so, the body of the target must be intact, and someone must heal it of at least one level of damage or the target will simply die again upon resurrection. Resurrecting a fallen person or creature can only be done within a number of minutes equal to or less than the Scion’s successes on the activation roll, and takes an amount of time equal to the length of time that the corpse in question has been dead, after which point it rises to live again.
### THE REAPER
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion becomes the embodiment of death, instantly killing mortals and gods and even affecting titans and avatars.

### ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon can link herself to the ground beneath her, borrowing its immovability for a short period of time. By standing on bare earth, stone or some other earthen substance and paying the requisite cost, the Scion becomes almost impossible to move; she becomes immune to knockback and knockdown and may only be lifted by an assailant with more dots of Epic Strength than she has Earth Boons. The Scion remains unshakable for the rest of the scene; she may move herself, but doing so breaks her connection to the earth and she must renew it if she wishes to become immovable again.
### SAFELY INTERRED ●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this Boon is attuned to the earth, which shifts itself to accommodate him when possible; he is never harmed by falling rubble, and even if buried beneath the earth itself takes no crushing penalties (though air may still be an issue). He takes no damage from earth-based trauma, including uses of other Earth purviews, and no longer suffers any penalty for unstable footing as long as he stands on earth of some kind.
### ECHO SOUNDING ●●
**Cost:** None
**Dice Pool:** Perception + Awareness
By tapping, stomping or knocking on the ground, the Scion with this Boon may judge its depth and hardness, whether there are any buried items or holes beneath it, and how far away such items might be. She may successfully sound an amount of earth equal to her successes in miles, spread as she chooses between depth and radius. The Scion may only use this Boon on the earth itself or on the ground floor of a building with no air space between it and the ground.
### TECTONIC STRENGTH ●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** None
By touching the earth to which she is attuned, the Scion with this Boon may draw strength from it to augment her own abilities. She may touch the earth at any time to commune with it (2 turn action); once she has done so and paid the requisite cost, she may add twice her total number of Earth Boons to her Strength rating for the next feat of strength she attempts. This Boon does not stack with itself; it can be used to augment a specific feat only once.
### SHAPING ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene
**Dice Pool:** Dexterity + Art (related)
The Scion with this Boon may shape any dirt, metal, glass, or other earth-based substance as though it were malleable clay, creating objects, artwork or even merely escape routes with ease. The Scion may only shape up to one cubic yard of earth per success on his activation roll.
### SUMMON GOBLINS ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
By calling forth in a commanding manner, the Scion may summon goblins to do her bidding. Upon being summoned, the goblins must be paid with their preferred price, a meat pie (alternatively, they will accept a magical item – a trinket, relic, or trophy – or a lump-sum payment of 3 Legend per goblin; however, these alternatives become very expensive very quickly); if they are not paid, they will refuse to obey the Scion’s commands and may even intentionally cause mischief for her before vanishing again. The summoned goblins possess the Safely Interred and Echo Sounding Boons, and can work tirelessly at simple tasks (digging, cleaning, farming, etc.), though more complicated orders may pose difficulties. For every three successes she garners on her activation roll, the Scion may choose to either summon an additional goblin or to add one day to the time that they will remain to serve her. If no extra days are purchased with successes, the goblins depart at sunset.
### EARTH ARMOR ●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
By stomping on some naked earthen ground or surface, a Scion with this Boon can cause a cloud of that earth to fly up around him, creating armor of hardened earth around his body, granting him an additional bashing and lethal soak equal to his total number of Earth Boons as well as making him immune to piercing on weapons and weighing him down with a -2 mobility penalty to movements. This Boon requires that some earthen substance be available nearby, but it may be used in conjunction with other armoring powers. The armor remains for a scene, after which it turns back into its constituent earth.
### RUST/SHINE ●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion with this boon has mastered the rot and reformation of metal; she may restore any rusted item to its unmarred, brilliant original state, or alternatively cause a metal object (even one normally impervious to oxidization) to instantly and spontaneously rust, cutting its soak in half. If the Scion chooses to use this power on a weapon, she may give it a +4 bonus to its accuracy for the remainder of the day as she removes the tiny inconsistencies and imperfections that might cause it to waver, or a -4 negative as she causes it to become pitted and unwieldy; if she chooses to spend a permanent point of Willpower, she may make this bonus or penalty permanent.
### EARTH TRAVEL ●●●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** None
Like a fish, the Scion with this power may swim through earth and rock itself as easily as if it were water for the rest of the scene, leaving no trail behind him. He may not pass through manmade alloys, and while he always instinctively knows in which direction the surface lies, he has no extra innate knowledge of his location or what might be above him.
### QUICKSAND ●●●●●
**Cost:** 2 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival
The Scion with this Boon may create a vast quagmire of sucking quicksand with a thought, covering an area of up to three square yards for every success she gains on her activation roll (this requires that she have existing earth or stone to work with, but any kind will do). Anyone caught within the quicksand’s radius becomes unable to take Dash actions and incurs a mobility penalty equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons; on their action, they must receive at least five successes on a Strength + Athletics roll to avoid being sucked further into the bog, and each consecutive roll adds one to the difficulty. Any unfortunate target that fails three such rolls is sucked completely under, there to suffocate to death unless rescued. Beings with the Divine Balance knack are immune to these effects. The Scion herself may spend one additional point of Legend to swim within the affected area as if she had the Lightning Swimmer knack, affording her the opportunity for quick travel or getaways.
### EARTH BODY ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 1 Legend, or 3 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
By calling out the name of the substance he wishes to turn into and converting his body to pure earth or stone, the Scion with this Boon becomes immobile, able to hear and see around him while disguised as an innocuous statue. If he chooses to pay the greater cost, he may also have the ability to move while thus transformed (he may, if he chooses to pay the lower cost, pay the difference at any time to begin moving). The Scion may use the Shaping Boon, if he possesses it, to change his own appearance however he sees fit, though any changes will vanish when he reverts to his usual form; others may not use the Shaping Boon on him, as he is only temporarily made of stone. The Scion’s soaks increase by half his total number of Earth Boons, and he is unaffected by armor-piercing or –ignoring effects; however, he also gains a mobility penalty of -4 and becomes 100 pounds heavier for every Earth Boon he possesses, making him difficult to move and potentially hazardous on any but the most sturdy of floors.
### EARTHBORN SPIRIT ●●●●● ●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
When a Scion possesses this boon, her control over the earth is so great that she may summon up its very spirit to act on her behalf. Upon paying the requisite cost, the Scion summons a ten-foot-tall earth elemental of enormous strength and endurance which obeys her commands to the best of its ability. For every five successes past the first on her activation roll, the Scion may summon an additional elemental; alternatively, she may add 3 to her already-summoned elementals’ health and soaks, 2 to their damage, and 1 to their accuracy, speed, and DV. The elemental receives ten automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities if unaugmented:
|Accuracy: 5 |Damage: 10 |Soaks: 25 |
|---|---|---|
|Health: 25 |Speed: 15 |DV: 13 |
The elementals possess the same level 5 Earth Boon(s) as the Scion and need never pay for them, though they may only use them once per scene. In addition, the elementals may at any time reform in front of another person or object at the Scion’s discretion and absorb an attack directed at it, provided that they are holding action or Guarding at the time (this is a 2 turn). Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the elemental’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the elemental returns to the earth whence it came.
### IMPRISONING CRYSTAL ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 2 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Survival
The Scion with this Boon may imprison a target in a gigantic clear crystal, completely immobilizing them and preventing any damage from being done to them while they are so captured. The Scion must overcome her target’s Strength + Fortitude roll in order to trap them, and any threshold successes are applied to the crystal’s soak and health levels (which begin at a base equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons, multiplied by two). A trapped creature is effectively in stasis, unable to move, speak, or interact with others, but also immune to the effects of aging, disease, wounds, etc. The crystal lasts for a number of days equal to the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons unless she chooses to expend an additional two points of Willpower, in which case it remains for a number of additional days equal to her threshold successes.
### LANDSLIDE ●●●●● ●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Survival
No longer confined to small samples of earth, the Scion may now shape massive quantities of raw materials with a thought. Upon activating this Boon, the Scion becomes able to mentally control and change a quantity of earth and stone equal to five times his successes in cubic yards; he may cause mountains and walls to thrust up from the ground, open yawning sinkholes, or attempt to crush his enemies with an onslaught of earth. Targets of the Scion’s wrath (or anyone within the affected area) may attempt to keep their footing and avoid being injured with a successful Dexterity + Athletics roll; if they overcome his successes on the activation roll, they are able to keep up with the quickly shifting landscape and take no damage or movement penalties. If they fail, the Scion controlling the earth may inflict a -4 penalty to all rolls on them at any time he chooses during the scene (unless they possess the Divine Balance knack, in which case they are immune). As a 1 turn action, the Scion may use the earth he controls to make a precision strike against up to four targets by rolling against their DV; if he strikes, he does an amount of damage equal to his threshold plus five times his total number of Earth Boons to the unfortunate victims. Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the Scion’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess. The Scion may also sculpt and shape the earth under his command as he chooses; if he wishes, he may use this Boon to make one dramatic permanent alteration to the landscape, such as creating an island or mountain or burying an entire village. If two Scions attempt to use this Boon on the same land at the same time, the one with the higher roll takes control for the next 2 turns, at which point the other may initiate another roll to contest it.
### EARTH CREATION ●●●●● ●●●
**Cost:** 1 Legend per 2 cubic yards
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion may create a sphere of any earthen substance (dirt, untainted metal, glass, etc.) out of thin air. The Scion may create as much earth as he wishes to pay for.
### PROPERTY INFUSION ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 5 Legend per use
**Dice Pool:** Intelligence + Art (appropriate)
The Scion with this Boon bends the rules of the natural world to her whim, playing with the very elemental building blocks that make up its foundations. By paying the requisite amount, the Scion may permanently alter any one earthen substance that he is touching so that it possesses a specific quality of another, giving glass walls the resilience of iron, common dirt the brilliance of gold, or formerly trusty weapons the room-temperature melt of mercury. If the Scion wishes to attempt to affect a Relic, he must overcome five times the Relic’s rating on his activation roll in order to do so. These changes are permanent and may not stack (that is, this Boon may not be used to enhance a given item more than once), though a Scion may attempt to remove modifications to an item with the use of this Boon.
### EARTH BEAST ●●●●● ●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** Charisma + Command
The Scion with this power may command the most awesome of the earth’s creatures, a being of stone, mud or immovable dirt. A massive creature (each Scion should chose a unique creature to represent him upon purchasing this Boon, appropriate to his character and culture of origin) created from the bones of the earth itself, the beast will fulfill the Scion’s commands to the best of its abilities, giving him a gigantic war machine poised at his command. The beast receives 20 automatic successes to all physical feats or attacks and has the following abilities:
|Accuracy: 10 |Damage: 20 |Soaks: 50 |
|---|---|---|
|Health: 200 |Speed: 15 |DV: 10 |
The beast naturally possesses the Earth Travel Boon and need never pay for it; it also possesses whichever level 7 Earth Boon the Scion does, and may use it for free as a 10-tick action. In addition, the creature may use the following special powers:
Intercept – the beast may at any time place itself in front of another person or object at the Scion’s discretion and absorb an attack directed at it, provided that it is holding action or Guarding at the time (this is a 5-tick action).
Rupture – the beast may take a 10-tick action, during which time it is Inactive; at the end of that time, it may burst out of the earth and attack its target with the element of surprise, rendering their DV down to 0 (this element of surprise may be circumvented by anyone with the Echo Sounding boon active, as he or she will hear the creature’s approach). Targets who are also skilled in the Earth purview have an additional soak versus the beast’s attacks equal to the number of Earth Boons they possess, and may add the same amount to all damage when attacking the creature. At the end of the scene, the dragon returns from whence it came, leaving the Scion on his own once again.
### MAGMA CONTROL ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 10 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** Manipulation + Survival
The destructive blood of the earth, pure molten magma and lava, are now under the Scion’s direct control. He is immune to damage or burning from any form of molten rock, and may direct the flow of up to ten times his total number of Earth Boons in cubic yards of it, creating barriers or even attacking hapless enemies with its devastating power (a Scion with the Echo Sounding Boon active may even control magma beneath the earth that he cannot see). Attacks made with magma or lava use Strength + Survival to hit, and inflict dice of aggravated damage equal to 10 plus the Scion’s successes (in addition, the lava may damage Relics); the target continues to lose one health level every five ticks thereafter as the lava slowly burns through him for a further number of ticks equal to half the Scion’s total number of Earth Boons.
### SEISMIC DISRUPTION ●●●●● ●●●●●
**Cost:** 15 Legend and 2 Willpower per use
**Dice Pool:** Strength + Survival
The Scion with this Boon may shift and shake the very tectonic plates of the earth itself, causing massive quakes and tremors to devastate the countryside wherever she chooses. By spending the requisite cost and striking the ground or screaming her command to the earth, the Scion may cause it to shudder and buck, inciting a full earthquake with Richter Scale severity equal to one tenth of her successes to strike in her immediate area, regardless of whether or not the tectonic plates beneath her are inclined toward violence. The quake’s effects may only be avoided on a person-by-person basis by a successful roll of either Dexterity + Athletics or Stamina + Fortitude; if any person does not succeed in this roll, they immediately suffer from knockdown and take bashing damage equal to the Scion’s threshold successes. The earthquake’s full effects are as follows:
|Richter Scale Rating |Difficulty to Avoid Damage |Mortal Population Killed |Earthquake’s Effects |After-Effects |
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1 – 3 |— |— |Minor tremors, consternation |— |
|4 |5 |5% |Only those at the epicenter roll (those with Cat’s Grace are immune) |— |
|5 |8 |5% |Range of 10 miles (those with Divine Balance are immune) |— |
|6 |11 |5% |Severe damage to small buildings and bridges, range of 100 miles |— |
|7 |15 (within 100 miles) or 11 (within 500 miles) |10% |Severe damage to large buildings, range of 1,000 miles |A few local Richter 5 aftershocks |
|8 |20 (within 100 miles) or 15 (within 500 miles) or 10 (within 1000 miles) |10% |Total destruction of all buildings, severe damage for 500 miles, full range of 2,000 miles |A few Richter 6 aftershocks on the same continent; a few tsunamis |
|9 |30 (within 1000 miles) or 20 (within 2000 miles) ot 10 (within 3000 miles) |10% |Total destruction of all landscape and creations within 100 miles, full range of 5,000 miles |Worldwide tsunamis and aftershocks of varying severity |
|10 |40 (within 2000 miles) or 20 (within 3000 miles) or 10 (within 5000 miles) |20% |Total destruction of all landscape and creations within 500 miles, severe damage to major buildings with 1,000 miles, damage to small buildings within 3,000 miles, heavy tremors within 5,000 miles, full range of 10,000 miles |Islands sink, volcanoes erupt, tsunamis and aftershocks of intense severity worldwide |
### THE SHAPER
**Cost:** 30 Legend and 1 Willpower per scene
**Dice Pool:** None
The Scion becomes the avatar of the earth itself, able to cause immobile masses to move, destroy buildings, or raise the ground up with him.
